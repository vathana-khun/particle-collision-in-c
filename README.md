# particle-collision-in-c
I'm trying to make a simple particle collision written in c for learning, since I have done this before in processing. Thus I am interested in other possible computer graphic program. And I came across SDL library and want to try it out.
Here are resources that I find helpful:
- Collision Detection: https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/collision-detection#rectangle-point-collision
- Processing example of collision and motion https://processing.org/examples/circlecollision.html
- Youtube video on the general principal and ideas behind particle collision: https://youtu.be/eED4bSkYCB8?si=4KOri9YXIRfGgl_s
- A document explaining 2D collison: https://www.vobarian.com/collisions/2dcollisions2.pdf
- Very helpful tutorial on SDL: https://youtu.be/XfZ6WrV5Z7Y?si=M0XwcDgpQM_V4CHm
